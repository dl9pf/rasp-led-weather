RaspLEDWeather
==============

Just a simple app that shows weather forecast on an RGB LED conneted to GPIO
pins of a Raspberry Pi. It makes use of Geoclue to find the user's location and
libgweather to fetch the weather forecast and gpiozero library to access the
LED.

Here is how it's supposed to behave:

* blink red 3 times, each time weather is updated (first time on launch).
* forecast is updated every hour.
* forecast is shown for every 12 hours, for next 3 days.
* each forecast is shown for 15 seconds.
* blink green N times before showing each forecast, where N is index of
  12 hours. E.g 2 blinks mean the following forecast is for 24 hours from
  now.
* Forecast is shown as colors:
  * yellow:       Sunny/Clear sky
  * green yellow: Cloudy (> 5 oktas)
  * cyan:         Light rain
  * blue:         Heavy rain
  * white:        Snow
